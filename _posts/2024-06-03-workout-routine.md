# The Hilarious Realities of Starting a Workout Routine

You know the drill. You’ve finally worked up the motivation to start exercising. You’ve bought the workout gear, downloaded the fitness app, and maybe even posted a "new me" selfie for extra accountability. Everything feels great—until you actually start working out. That’s when reality hits, and it’s much funnier (and more painful) than you expected.

Let’s take a look at the hilarious and all-too-relatable stages of starting a new workout routine!

### Stage 1: The Overly Ambitious Planning Phase

It always starts with **big plans**. You’re scrolling through workout videos on YouTube, pinning motivational quotes on Pinterest, and mentally preparing yourself to go from couch potato to superhero-level fitness in a matter of weeks. "I’ll work out five days a week, maybe even six!" you think to yourself, blissfully unaware of the pain to come.

#### What You Think Will Happen:

- You’ll transform into a fitness guru overnight.
- You’ll develop a six-pack in two weeks.
- You’ll run a marathon by next month.

#### What Actually Happens:

- You sign up for one yoga class and need a nap immediately after.
- You spend more time Googling “how to stretch sore muscles” than actually exercising.
- Your workout clothes become your “Netflix and chill” clothes.

### Stage 2: The First Workout (A.K.A. The Shock to Your System)

The first workout is always a humbling experience. You hit the gym or press play on your at-home workout video with high hopes, ready to crush it. Five minutes in, reality hits. **Burpees are the devil**, and squats feel like a betrayal to your legs. Your muscles are screaming, and you wonder if you can still return that fitness app subscription.

#### Classic First Workout Moments:

- Realizing you’re out of breath _just from the warm-up_.
- Getting stuck in a plank position because you can’t remember how to stand back up.
- Looking in the mirror, only to find that you’re not sweating attractively—nope, you’re just drenched.

### Stage 3: The Post-Workout Delusion

You somehow survived your first workout. You’re sore, but you’re also proud. In fact, you’re feeling great! You might even start flexing in the mirror, convinced that you already see some muscle definition. "This wasn’t so bad," you tell yourself. "I can totally do this every day!"

#### The Reality:

- You’ll wake up the next morning and feel like you’ve been hit by a bus.
- Simple tasks like walking, sitting, and breathing suddenly become a challenge.
- You’ll question every life choice that led you to that workout.

### Stage 4: The DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) Struggle

DOMS is the sneaky villain that shows up after your workout, usually one or two days later, just when you think you’re in the clear. **You will be sore**—like, can’t-walk-upstairs, can’t-lift-your-arms sore. And yet, fitness experts will still cheerfully encourage you to “keep going!”

#### Typical DOMS Struggles:

- Trying to sit down in a chair without wincing.
- Feeling like your legs have turned to jelly when you attempt stairs.
- Reaching for something on a high shelf and realizing you have the upper body strength of a cooked noodle.

### Stage 5: The Endless Internal Debate (Should I Work Out Again?)

A few days after your initial workout, the soreness subsides. Now comes the **moment of truth**—will you work out again? The memory of your last session is still fresh, and the couch looks awfully inviting. But you’re also determined to stick with your routine… right?

#### The Inner Monologue:

- “I should work out today, but maybe I’ll start tomorrow.”
- “If I skip today, it’s not _really_ skipping. I’m just resting my muscles!”
- “Let me watch one motivational video before I decide… three hours later, okay, maybe tomorrow.”

### Stage 6: The Random Burst of Motivation

After a week of sporadic (or nonexistent) exercise, you suddenly get hit with a random burst of motivation. Maybe you saw a fitness post on social media, or maybe you just feel guilty for not working out. Either way, you’re back in the game—if only for a brief moment.

#### What Happens:

- You tell yourself, “Today, I’m really going to push myself!”
- You attempt an advanced workout video that’s way beyond your current fitness level.
- You end up laying on the floor, staring at the ceiling, wondering how people actually _enjoy_ this.

### Stage 7: The Moment of Acceptance

Eventually, you find your groove. Maybe you’re not working out five days a week, but two or three feels manageable. You’ve accepted that progress will be slow and that the soreness never really goes away—but that’s okay. You’re doing your best, and that’s what matters.

#### What Acceptance Looks Like:

- Realizing that workouts will never be glamorous, but they can be fun (or at least tolerable).
- Finally understanding that fitness influencers make it look easy because they’re mutants.
- Accepting that some days, just showing up in your workout clothes counts as a win.

### Conclusion: Laugh Your Way Through It

Starting a workout routine is hard—physically, mentally, and often emotionally. But it’s also hilarious when you look back at all the awkward, painful, and downright ridiculous moments along the way. The key to sticking with it? **A sense of humor**. Laughing at yourself makes the journey a whole lot easier.

So, if you’ve recently started a workout routine and feel like a flailing fish out of water, just remember—you’re not alone. We’ve all been there, and we’re all just trying to get through it, one shaky squat at a time.
