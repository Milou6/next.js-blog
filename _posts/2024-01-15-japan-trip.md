##### Understanding CSS Grid and Flexbox: A Comprehensive Guide for Front-End Developers

As front-end developers, creating flexible and responsive layouts is a critical part of our work. While older methods like floats and positioning were used for this, modern web development has given us two essential tools for layout creation: **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.

But when should you use Grid over Flexbox? How do they differ, and can they be used together? In this post, we will break down each of these technologies, understand their use cases, and share tips to help you make better layout decisions in your next project.

##### What is CSS Flexbox?

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that controls the alignment and distribution of space among items in a container. It excels at managing items in either a row or a column, which makes it perfect for simpler, linear layouts.

###### Key Features of Flexbox:

- **Align and distribute space**: Easily align items horizontally and vertically.
- **Responsive by design**: Flexbox adapts naturally to various screen sizes.
- **Simple centering**: Centering elements both vertically and horizontally is effortless.

###### Common Use Cases:

- Creating navigation bars
- Aligning items in a row (e.g., card layouts)
- Vertical centering in a flexible container
